I made my shape with 2 circles and a rectangle. I used the If Else statements to shange the fill and stroke with (x) changes, and the scale when the mouse is pressed.
I created a new function called funShape, and moved all my code (the shapes and the if else statements) into that new function.
After, I modified my first If Else statement, using the changeFill and changeStroke knobs to make it from (Lavender,Thistle) to (Plum,MediumOrchid). Those changes happen in the draw function, using my new function funShape.
